WELCOME TO THE MADNESS!

MADNESS: Figment is a text based game exploring the world of Madness Combat by Matt “Krinkels” Jolly. In this text based game, you will be playing as Hank J. Wimbleton exploring a dreamscape of his own.

One of the things learned in this project is the random command and library. I'm also using the time command.
More specifically with the random library, I used the randint and choice functions.
Using functions proved to be somewhat difficult, as I struggled to connect functions with variables I had in my main code, and this took me about two days to figure out. I ended up learning that you can use the same variables in both the functions and your main code, which is what I ended up doing and found that this was the solution I needed.
