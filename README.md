WELCOME TO THE MADNESS!

MADNESS: Figment is a text based game exploring the world of Madness Combat by Matt “Krinkels” Jolly. In this text based game, you will be playing as Hank J. Wimbleton exploring a dreamscape of his own.

One of the things learned in this project is the random command and library. I'm also using the time command.
More specifically with the random library, I used the randint and choice functions.
